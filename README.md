# Q&A App

Noting how difficult it is to develop mobile apps for services relying on multiple listings, we decided to build a sample Q&A app helping users find a rated doctor. The app capitalizes on the flexibility afforded by content structure on [Contentful][1] to speed up data entry and maintenance.

The app works on iOS 7 and uses the [Contentful iOS SDK][2].

**This app was made during an internal hackathon and is not officially supported.**

[Contentful][1] is a content management platform for web applications, mobile apps and connected devices. It allows you to create, edit & manage content in the cloud and publish it anywhere via powerful API. Contentful offers tools for managing editorial teams and enabling cooperation between organizations.
